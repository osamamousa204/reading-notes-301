# Node.js

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. It is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching.

node.js, commonly just called Node, is often used for developing applications that rely on the ability to run javascript both on the client and server side. Running the same language on both the client and the server benefits from improved code reusability and the less context switching.

A notable feature of node.js is that it is non-blocking – if one task stalls or pauses for an I/O operation, another can take over while it is idle. This allows for high efficiency as the program as a whole never has to idle and wait for one task to finish. Libraries such as async take advantage of this capability. More information can be found here.

It's also possible to use mature JavaScript frameworks like YUI and jQuery for server-side DOM manipulation in node.js.

### Applications that can be written using Node.js include, but are not limited to:
Static file servers
Web Application frameworks
Messaging middleware
Servers for HTML5 multi player games, or streaming audio/video
Real time applications
Cross-platform programs

## What Is Node.js Used For?

installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.
