Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

# Pure functions

The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions. But what does that really mean? What makes a function pure?
So how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

# Functions as first-class entities

The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.
Functions as first-class entities can:
refer to it from constants and variables
pass it as a parameter to other functions
return it as result from other functions
The idea is to treat functions as values and pass functions like data. This way we can combine different functions to create new functions with new behavior.
