# Using EJS to Template our Node Application


When creating quick on-the-fly Node applications, an easy and fast way to template our application is sometimes necessary. So far we've been building out full MEAN applications and Angular acts as our templating engine.

For applications that need quick templating, there are many options that we can use. Jade comes as the view engine for Express by default . EJS is one alternative does that job well and is very easy to set up.



# features

* Fast compilation and rendering
* Simple template tags: <% %>
* Custom delimiters (e.g., use <? ?> instead of <% %>)
* Includes
* Both server JS and browser support
* Static caching of intermediate JavaScript
* Static caching of templates
* Complies with the Express view system
* Authorizing requests with OAuth 2.0
* Requests to the Books API for non-public user data must be authorized by an authenticated user.

### EJS let's us spin up quick applications when we don't need anything too complex. By using partials and having the ability to easily pass variables to our views, we can build some great applications quickly.
